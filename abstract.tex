\subsection*{Abstract}
 
Applications that perform continuous sensing on mobile pho\-nes have the
potential to revolutionize everyday life.  Examples range from medical
and health monitoring applications, such as pedometers and fall
detectors, to participatory sensing applications, such as pollution
and traffic monitoring.  Unfortunately, current mobile devices are a
poor match for continuous sensing applications as they require the
device to remain awake for extended periods of time, causing fast
battery drainage.  This paper proposes a new approach that offloads a
simple configurable event detection classifier to a low power
processor and wakes up the main processor only when an event of
interest occurs.  This approach differs from other heterogeneous
architectures in that developers are presented with a programming
interface that lets them construct application specific classifiers
from a set of predefined pre-processing algorithms and tuning their
parameters.
