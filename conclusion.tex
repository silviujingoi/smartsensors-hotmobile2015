\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we proposed {\em Simple Configurable Classifiers} (SCC),
a new approach for continuous mobile sensing.  In this approach, the
platform implements common sensor data pre-processing algorithms that
execute on a low-power sensor hub, and application developers
construct simple configurable classifiers for events of interest by
selecting among the set of pre-defined common pre-processing
algorithms and tuning their parameters.  We presented preliminary
results showing the benefits of using two configurable simple
classifiers as wake-up mechanisms the for two accelerometer-based
applications.

Our immediate future work includes developing a prototype board and 
performing a comprehensive evaluation of simple configurable 
classifiers for multiple sensors and applications. Further future work 
aims at tackling the challenges described in Section~\ref{sec:challenges}.
