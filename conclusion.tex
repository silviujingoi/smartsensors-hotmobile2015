\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we proposed {\em simple configurable classifiers}, a new
approach for continuous mobile sensing.  In this approach, the platform implements
common sensor data pre-processing algorithms that execute on a low-power sensor hub, and
application developers construct {\em simple configurable classifiers}
for events of interest by selecting among the set of pre-defined
common pre-processing algorithms and tuning their parameters.  We presented
preliminary results showing the performance of using two {\em configurable 
simple classifiers} as wake-up mechanisms the for two accelerometer-based applications.

Our immediate future work includes developing a prototype board and 
performing a comprehensive evaluation of {\em simple configurable 
classifiers} for multiple sensors and applications. Further future work 
aims at tackling some of the challenges described in Section~\ref{sec:challenges}.
